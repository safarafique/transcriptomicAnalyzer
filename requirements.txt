Complete Instructions for Uploading and Running Your Streamlit App on GitHub
Step 1: Download Your Files Locally
Download these files from this chat:

app.py (your app source code)

requirements.txt (list of Python packages)

Save them in a folder on your computer.

Step 2: Create a GitHub Repository
Log in to your GitHub account (create one if you donâ€™t have it).

Click the + icon at the top right and select New repository.

Enter a repository name (e.g., geo-microarray-app).

Optionally add a description.

Set repository visibility: Public or Private.

Check Add a README file (optional).

Click Create repository.

Step 3: Upload Files to GitHub
Option A: Upload via GitHub Website
Go into your newly created repo on GitHub.

Click Add file > Upload files.

Drag and drop your app.py and requirements.txt files.

Scroll down and click Commit changes.

Option B: Using Git Command Line
If you have Git installed on your machine and prefer the terminal:

Open your terminal/command prompt.

Change directory (cd) to the folder where your files are.

Initialize git (if this folder is not a git repo yet):

bash
git init
Add the GitHub repository as a remote:

bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
Replace yourusername and yourrepo with your GitHub username and repository name.

Add files to git:

bash
git add app.py requirements.txt
Commit files:

bash
git commit -m "Add Streamlit GEO microarray app"
Push files to GitHub remote:

bash
git push -u origin main
Step 4: Install Python Dependencies Locally (Optional)
On your local machine, set up the environment to run the app:

Optionally create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (Linux/macOS)
venv\Scripts\activate     # (Windows)
Install packages:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 5: Run the Streamlit App Locally
Run the app in your terminal from the folder with app.py:

bash
streamlit run app.py
It will launch a local web server and open the app in your browser.

Step 6: Deploy on Streamlit Cloud (Optional)
Connect your GitHub repository to Streamlit Cloud (streamlit.io/cloud).

Authorize GitHub access.

Select your repository and branch.

Streamlit Cloud will install dependencies from requirements.txt and deploy your app automatically.

Additional Notes
The requirements.txt ensures package consistency.

Make sure the GEO accessions you test with are valid and public datasets.

If you want, add a README on GitHub with these same instructions for others.
